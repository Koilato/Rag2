occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.",Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.,"https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

to version 2.3.2, and datatables.net prior to version 1.13.2:
    
    - An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use the flaw to send trial 
      messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages 
      the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection. (CVE-2022-4304)

    - The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes any header data and the payload 
      data. Under certain conditions, a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. (CVE-2022-4450)

    - The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. Under certain conditions, 
      the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously 
      freed filter BIO. This will most likely result in a crash. (CVE-2023-0215)

    - An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to load malformed PKCS7 data. The result of the 
      dereference is an application crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. (CVE-2023-0216)

    - An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the 
      EVP_PKEY_public_check() function. This will most likely lead to an application crash. (CVE-2023-0217)

    - A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being verified on PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash 
      algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the 
      digest initialization will fail. (CVE-2023-0401) 

    - A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking, which
      might result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. (CVE-2022-4203)

    - All versions of package datatables.net are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution due to an incomplete fix for 
      https:/snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-DATATABLESNET-598806. (CVE-2020-28458)

    - With the package datatables.net before 1.11.3 if an array is passed to the HTML escape entities function it would not 
      have its contents escaped. (CVE-2021-23445)

    - jQuery before 3.4.0, as used in Drupal, Backdrop CMS, and other products, mishandles jQuery.extend(true, {}, ...) because of 
      Object.prototype pollution. If an unsanitized source object contained an enumerable __proto__ property, it could extend the 
      native Object.prototype. (CVE-2019-11358)

    - In jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.0.3 and before 3.5.0, passing HTML containing <option> elements from untrusted 
      sources, even after sanitizing it, to one of jQuery DOM manipulation methods may execute untrusted code. (CVE-2020-11023)

    - jquery prior to 1.9.0 allows Cross-site Scripting attacks via the load method that fails to recognize and remove <script> 
      HTML tags that contain a whitespace character and trigger execution of the enclosed script logic. (CVE-2020-7656)",Upgrade to Tenable Nessus version 10.5.0 or later.,"https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2023-09

  - libxml2 before 2.12.10 and 2.13.x before 2.13.6 has a NULL pointer dereference in xmlPatMatch in
    pattern.c. (CVE-2025-27113)

  - In libxml2 2.11 before 2.11.9, 2.12 before 2.12.9, and 2.13 before 2.13.3, the SAX parser can produce
    events for external entities even if custom SAX handlers try to override entity content (by setting
    checked). This makes classic XXE attacks possible. (CVE-2024-40896)

  - An issue was discovered in libexpat before 2.6.4. There is a crash within the XML_ResumeParser function
    because XML_StopParser can stop/suspend an unstarted parser. (CVE-2024-50602)

  - libxml2 before 2.12.10 and 2.13.x before 2.13.6 has a use-after-free in xmlSchemaIDCFillNodeTables and
    xmlSchemaBubbleIDCNodeTables in xmlschemas.c. To exploit this, a crafted XML document must be validated
    against an XML schema with certain identity constraints, or a crafted XML schema must be used.
    (CVE-2024-56171)

  - A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the libexpat library due to the way it handles recursive entity
    expansion in XML documents. When parsing an XML document with deeply nested entity references, libexpat
    can be forced to recurse indefinitely, exhausting the stack space and causing a crash. This issue could
    lead to denial of service (DoS) or, in some cases, exploitable memory corruption, depending on the
    environment and library usage. (CVE-2024-8176)

  - libxml2 before 2.12.10 and 2.13.x before 2.13.6 has a stack-based buffer overflow in xmlSnprintfElements
    in valid.c. To exploit this, DTD validation must occur for an untrusted document or untrusted DTD. NOTE:
    this is similar to CVE-2017-9047. (CVE-2025-24928)
