occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.","https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

remote target and Nessus did not log any subsequent errors or failures
for the authentication protocol.

When possible, Nessus tracks errors or failures related to otherwise
valid credentials in order to highlight issues that may result in
incomplete scan results or limited scan coverage. The types of issues
that are tracked include errors that indicate that the account used
for scanning did not have sufficient permissions for a particular
check, intermittent protocol failures which are unexpected after the
protocol has been negotiated successfully earlier in the scan, and
intermittent authentication failures which are unexpected after a
credential set has been accepted as valid earlier in the scan. This
plugin reports when none of the above issues have been logged during
the course of the scan for at least one authenticated protocol. See
plugin output for details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  issues to be encountered for one protocol and not another.
  For example, authentication to the SSH service on the
  remote target may have consistently succeeded with no
  privilege errors encountered, while connections to the SMB
  service on the remote target may have failed
  intermittently.

- Resolving logged issues for all available authentication
  protocols may improve scan coverage, but the value of
  resolving each issue for a particular protocol may vary
  from target to target depending upon what data (if any) is
  gathered from the target via that protocol and what
  particular check failed. For example, consistently
  successful checks via SSH are more critical for Linux
  targets than for Windows targets, and likewise
  consistently successful checks via SMB are more critical
  for Windows targets than for Linux targets.","n/a","","Nessus was able to execute commands locally with sufficient privileges

    - An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use the flaw to send trial 
      messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages 
      the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection. (CVE-2022-4304)

      the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously 
      freed filter BIO. This will most likely result in a crash. (CVE-2023-0215)

    - An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to load malformed PKCS7 data. The result of the 
      dereference is an application crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. (CVE-2023-0216)

    - An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the 
      EVP_PKEY_public_check() function. This will most likely lead to an application crash. (CVE-2023-0217)

    - A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being verified on PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash 
      algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the 
      digest initialization will fail. (CVE-2023-0401) 

    - A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking, which
      might result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. (CVE-2022-4203)

to version 2.3.2, and datatables.net prior to version 1.13.2:
    
    - An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use the flaw to send trial 
      messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages 
      the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection. (CVE-2022-4304)

    - The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes any header data and the payload 
      data. Under certain conditions, a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. (CVE-2022-4450)

    - The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. Under certain conditions, 
      the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously 
      freed filter BIO. This will most likely result in a crash. (CVE-2023-0215)

    - An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to load malformed PKCS7 data. The result of the 
      dereference is an application crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. (CVE-2023-0216)

    - An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the 
      EVP_PKEY_public_check() function. This will most likely lead to an application crash. (CVE-2023-0217)

    - A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being verified on PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash 
      algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the 
      digest initialization will fail. (CVE-2023-0401) 

    - A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking, which
      might result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. (CVE-2022-4203)

    - All versions of package datatables.net are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution due to an incomplete fix for 
      https:/snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-DATATABLESNET-598806. (CVE-2020-28458)

    checked). This makes classic XXE attacks possible. (CVE-2024-40896)

  - An issue was discovered in libexpat before 2.6.4. There is a crash within the XML_ResumeParser function
    because XML_StopParser can stop/suspend an unstarted parser. (CVE-2024-50602)

    against an XML schema with certain identity constraints, or a crafted XML schema must be used.
    (CVE-2024-56171)

  - A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the libexpat library due to the way it handles recursive entity
    expansion in XML documents. When parsing an XML document with deeply nested entity references, libexpat
    can be forced to recurse indefinitely, exhausting the stack space and causing a crash. This issue could

    can be forced to recurse indefinitely, exhausting the stack space and causing a crash. This issue could
    lead to denial of service (DoS) or, in some cases, exploitable memory corruption, depending on the
    environment and library usage. (CVE-2024-8176)

  - libxml2 before 2.12.10 and 2.13.x before 2.13.6 has a stack-based buffer overflow in xmlSnprintfElements
    in valid.c. To exploit this, DTD validation must occur for an untrusted document or untrusted DTD. NOTE:
    this is similar to CVE-2017-9047. (CVE-2025-24928)

  - libxml2 before 2.12.10 and 2.13.x before 2.13.6 has a NULL pointer dereference in xmlPatMatch in
    pattern.c. (CVE-2025-27113)

  - In libxml2 2.11 before 2.11.9, 2.12 before 2.12.9, and 2.13 before 2.13.3, the SAX parser can produce
    events for external entities even if custom SAX handlers try to override entity content (by setting
    checked). This makes classic XXE attacks possible. (CVE-2024-40896)

  - An issue was discovered in libexpat before 2.6.4. There is a crash within the XML_ResumeParser function
    because XML_StopParser can stop/suspend an unstarted parser. (CVE-2024-50602)

  - libxml2 before 2.12.10 and 2.13.x before 2.13.6 has a use-after-free in xmlSchemaIDCFillNodeTables and
    xmlSchemaBubbleIDCNodeTables in xmlschemas.c. To exploit this, a crafted XML document must be validated
    against an XML schema with certain identity constraints, or a crafted XML schema must be used.
